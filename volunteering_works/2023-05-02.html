            Today, just the one volunteer, Peter. We continued the work of installing our tree identification stakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, a Commemorative plaque had arrived at the Arboretum. In the academic year 2021/22 the University celebrated 100 years since the first students enrolled in 1921. To mark this event 100 trees are being planted across the University campus. One for each year. A pear tree was ear-marked for the arboretum and was planted a few months back. This morning Peter and I took a few minutes to add the shiny new plaque to it's owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing with the stakes we had a steady and productive morning and managed to put in a further 4 stakes. Three of them have now been labelled, but sadly our stately London Plane has no label. It is missing. No fear, we shall see about a replacement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we are into the growing season and everything has put on a lot of growth in the last 2 weeks. I am afraid that I shall have to put the Tuesday morning volunteer sessions on hold for the future. I need to utilise this time to cover the rapidly expanding grass-cutting and pruning work that is now coming on-line both in our arboretum and at the neighbouring Knighton Hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thursday mornings will, of course, continue unabated and hopefully no-one will be too disappointed by this news. Another great day's work and see you all on Thursday !
