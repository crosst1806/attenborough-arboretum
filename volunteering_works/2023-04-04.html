            Digging holes and instating the posts for the specimen tree labels is not only hard work, but requires a professional touch to get the post at the correct depth, vertically aligned and solidly supported. We are fortunate indeed then, that amongst our number is a gentleman who is well versed in the process.

            Andy brings his experience of fence installation to our group. This experience, combined with his willingness to tackle this more difficult task, while we others enjoyed a more leisurely willow-weaving session, ensured that another set of posts were rapidly and expertly installed today. Thank you, Andy (Postmaster General).

            We continued our willow-weaving work with two objectives. The first was to inspect and start tidying and weaving in any new growth on the first structure that we had installed. The willow was obviously establishing well and new growth in the form of swelling buds and leaves emerging was the proof.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second objective was to use up the remaining willow whips before they completely dried out and would no longer establish. The aim was to install a second willow tunnel below the first. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This we did, putting in uprights first followed by a thinner pair of weavers between uprights. The willow seems to still be supple and moist enough to establish. Time will tell if our efforts are in vain or not, but the finished work was satisfying to view and as we practice our confidence at willow weaving builds.
