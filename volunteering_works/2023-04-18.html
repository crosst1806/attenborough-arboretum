            Today we continued working on our willow structures. Firstly, a little bit of weaving-in of the new growth. The willow is obviously establishing a root system as there is always some new growth and none of the whips appears to be dying. Good news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then onto the main task which was the putting down of wood chippings inside the tunnels. The willows are sitting in a damp area which is ideal conditions for willow to grow. However, this means that when walking down the inside of the tunnels the ground is muddy underfoot. Fortunately the solution was close to hand !

            Whilst some of our volunteers starting digging out the remaining bramble roots in the second tunnel, compost from our recycling bins was used as a hole filler for any depressions in the ground inside the first tunnel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another volunteer started breaking up and cleaning a pile of wood chippings that was sitting nearby. This was a pile made when tree surgeons took down an old and sick tree several years ago. Ideal material to be used as flooring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, barrow loads of the chippings were transported to the tunnels and spread out using a rake.
          </p>

            A good day's work.
