            The top entrance to the pond area from the wooden walk way.

            There is an area at the end of our first pond which is mostly cleared and has some old chippings down.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would probably add value to establish some kind of bird hide and seating area here, so that the pond and it's wildlife can be quietly observed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we started the initial step towards this goal. Namely clearing two paths into the area. One path from the wooden pond walkway at the the top, and the second leading up from the pathway at the bottom through banks of nettles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top entrance was only a relatively short distance to clear.

            The lower entrance would have to be several metres long and through waist high nettles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first task was to clear away dead wood and trample a path through the undergrowth.
          </p>
          <p>
            This done, use was made of a convenient pile of nearby wood chippings.
          </p>
          <p>
            With some willing hands, a wheel barrow and spade, we soon had a thick layer of bark chippings laid down along this path to make a wide and easy means of access to the pond area.

            Break time today was a little different. As well as the usual tea and biscuits a quick lesson in botany was given
          </p>
          <p>
            The arboretum is full of Lords-and-ladies (Arum maculatum), which is a shade-loving tuberous perennial, native to UK woodlands and hedgerows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lords-and-ladies have an interesting flower structure and are pollinated by flies.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our volunteers, being a botanist, was able to explain and demonstrate this process to us, with a sample plant and a handy penknife.
            Fascinating.
