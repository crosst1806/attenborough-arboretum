                This is the most common elm found in Scotland, Wales and northern England and has proved more resistant to Dutch elm disease than most elms. Unlike most elms wych elm reproduces itself by seed, rather than by suckers from the roots of the parent tree. It's canopy spreads more broadly than that of the English elm, although the tree is not so tall.

                Small flowers with long purple-tipped stamens appear in conspicuous clusters in February and March. The oval leaves are up to 6 inches long and roughly hairy. The buds and twigs are both a chestnut-brown and hairy. The fruits are winged.

                Britain's only native maple is a small round-headed tree often found growing in hedgerows and thus trimmed back to form part of the
                hedgerow. As such it makes avery good hedging plant. It's a compact, rounded tree with attractive 5-lobed leaves that turn a rich golden 
                yellow in autumn. It produces the hardest, highest density timber of all European maples.In woodlands on chalky soils in the south-east of the country it may grow taller, but seldom as high as the other maples. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The tree can be easily recognised by the rounded lobes of it's leaves. It has has corky twigs and a ribbed grey or light brown bark with fine shallow fissures. Small flowers appear in the upright spikes in May or June. fruits form in pairs, with with the wings set straighter than in other maples.

                Clusters of bright yellow flower appearing in March and leaves that turn golden-orange in the Autumn make the Norway maple a popular ornamental tree for planting in city streets and parks. It is a very hardy tree. This is not surprising as it is a native of Scandanavia, from where it was introduced to the British Isles in the 17th century.

              <p>
                The Norway maple is a shorter and more slender tree than the sycamore, with a more open crown and less dense foliage.The leaves are thin, shiny and light green in colour. The lobes on the leaves are sharply pointed.

                The massive domed outline of the sycamore, tallest and commonest member of the maple family, has become a familiar sight in Britain's gardens and woods since it was introduced from France in the Middle Ages. The sycamore has proved hardy even in the bleakest of conditions, and spreads vigorously, even on waste ground, by means of it's winged fruits. These twirl through the October air like tiny helicopter blades.
              </p>
              <p>
                The leaves, often spotted with disease, are set in opposite pairs and the branches are spread out evenly. The flowers appear in May and June. The leaves are large and leathery. The teeth are regular and the foliage is dark green in colour.

                The distinctive candles of white flowers first appear in May and are then followed by the familiar spiky fruits in Autumn. These 'conkers' have been treasured by children for generations. Large sticky terminal winter buds and the horshoe-like leaf scars are further distinctive features of this tree. The leaf itself is compound and it made up of five to seven large leaflets.

                The smooth light grey bark of the hornbeam is similar to that of the beech. However the truck is fluted. Hornbeam also has a unique feature - hanging clusters of triangular, ribbed nutlets surrounded by long, three-lobbed bracts.

                The leaf-buds are shorter and broader than those of the beech, and the leaves are double-toothed. Male flowers form in drooping catkins, female in leafy buds. The leaves are pointed with toothed edges and distinctive parallel veins. The leaf-stalks are reddish in colour.

              The common alder is one of the few trees whose leaves remain green well into the autumn. But it is the catkins that appear that give the tree it's unmistakable main characteristic. After the fruits of the female catkins have ripened in October they stay on the tree all winter as small brown woody cones, until the seeds are all dispersed in the spring.
              </p>
              <p>
              The leaves of the common alder are roundish oval in shape and shiny. The tips of the leaves are often notched, as though a small bite had been taken out of the leaf. It's cousin the Grey Alder (Alnus incana) can be distinguished by a grey underside to the leaf. The leaves are also pointed and toothed. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Alders often grow near rivers as they prefer wet environments. The alder's suckers make it useful at binding river banks and the tree can grow up to 80ft in height.

                The billowing foliage of the English elm was once one of the characteristic features of the English landscape. Since Dutch elm disease re-entered the country in 1967, more than 12 milliion English elms have been destroyed. The tragedy is all the greater in that the elm takes at least 150 years to reach it's full glory.

                The English elm has a massive trunk and branches, and bark with long fissures. The smooth-leaved elm (Ulmus minor), seen only in southern and eastern England, is narrower and only grows to about 90ft.

              <p>
                The oval leaves are about 4 inches long, double-toothed and with a rounded tip. They are also rough on the topside. Delicate crimson flowers tinge the bough of the tree in spring.
