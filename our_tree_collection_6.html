                This is the most common elm found in Scotland, Wales and northern England and has proved more resistant to Dutch elm disease than most elms. Unlike most elms wych elm reproduces itself by seed, rather than by suckers from the roots of the parent tree. It's canopy spreads more broadly than that of the English elm, although the tree is not so tall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Small flowers with long purple-tipped stamens appear in conspicuous clusters in February and March. The oval leaves are up to 6 inches long and roughly hairy. The buds and twigs are both a chestnut-brown and hairy. The fruits are winged.

                The billowing foliage of the English elm was once one of the characteristic features of the English landscape. Since Dutch elm disease re-entered the country in 1967, more than 12 milliion English elms have been destroyed. The tragedy is all the greater in that the elm takes at least 150 years to reach it's full glory.
              </p>
              <p>
                The English elm has a massive trunk and branches, and bark with long fissures. The smooth-leaved elm (Ulmus minor), seen only in southern and eastern England, is narrower and only grows to about 90ft.
              </p>
              <p>
                The oval leaves are about 4 inches long, double-toothed and with a rounded tip. They are also rough on the topside. Delicate crimson flowers tinge the bough of the tree in spring.
