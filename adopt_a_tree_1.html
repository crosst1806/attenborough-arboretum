            In 1997 the Aboretum was officlaly opened by Sir David Attenborough and a number of Leicester and
            Leicestershire schools planted trees. The trees were labelled with the name of the donor school, so 
            allowing the trees progress to be observed, monitored and recorded during following visits.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Below is a list of schools that have planted and sponsored trees. If your school would like to 'adopt' a tree,
            whether or not you have already planted one, please contact the 'SEED' office or speak to the teacher leading
            your visit.
