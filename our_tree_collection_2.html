                The brilliant green of a beech wood, just as it comes into full leaf, is a memorable sight. Inside such a wood all is shady even on the sunniest of days, because of the dense leaf canopy. Little else in the way of plant life will manage to grow at ground level. Older trees have a massive many branched dome and present a spectacular display in the autumn when the leaves turn first orange and then rich red-brown.
              </p>
              <p>
                In autumn the familiar triangular beech nutlets contain pairs of nuts which are highly favoured by squirrels. Beech leaves are a shiny green with a wavy margin and distinctive veins. Beech is widespread throughout the British Isles.

                This tall, handsome tree provides on of the most valuable of timbers, the raw materialfor a variety of products from oars and axe handles to farm carts and furniture. The leaves of the ash tree are particularly distinctive, made up of nine to thirteen pale-green leaflets.

                The branches are smooth, grey or ash-coloured, with conspicuous hard black velvety buds. These black buds come in opposite pairs on a grey coloured twig.

                  Larix decidua, the European larch, is a species of larch native to the mountains of central Europe, in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains as well as the Pyrenees, with disjunct lowland populations in northern Poland and southern Lithuania. It is widely naturalized in Scandinavia. Its life span has been confirmed to be close to 1000 years, but is more often around 200 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Larix decidua is a medium-size to large deciduous coniferous tree reaching 25-45 m tall, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter. The crown is conic when young, becoming broad with age; the main branches are level to upswept, with the side branches often pendulous. The shoots are dimorphic, with growth divided into long shoots (typically 10-50 cm long) and bearing several buds, and short shoots only 1-2 mm long with only a single bud. The leaves are needle-like, light green, 2-4 cm long which turn bright yellow before they fall in the autumn, leaving the pale yellow-buff shoots bare until the next spring.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The cones are erect, ovoid-conic, 2-6 cm long, with 10-90 erect or slightly incurved (not reflexed) seed scales; they are green variably flushed red when immature, turning brown and opening to release the seeds when mature, 4-6 months after pollination. The old cones commonly remain on the tree for many years, turning dull grey-black.
              </p>
              <p>
                  It is very cold tolerant, able to survive winter temperatures down to at least -50C, and is among the tree line trees in the Alps, reaching 2400 m altitude, though most abundant from 1000-2000 m. It only grows on well-drained soils, avoiding waterlogged ground and is not shade tolerant.
