                There are two badger setts within the boundaries of the Attenborough Arboretum. There are many different kinds of badger spread across the globe, but here in the UK we have only the European Badger.
                </p>
                <p>
                The European badger is a strange looking creature with some habits in common with humans. For instance, they keep their setts meticulously clean and regularly change the 'bedding' of straw and grass. They also choose a partner and remain faithful to that partner for life.
              </p>
              <p>
                With his striking markings and strange habits the shy badger is one of the oddest creatures to be found in Great Britain. Badgers are found in most of our counties, but are rarer in those areas which are prone to flooding, such as East Anglia.

                From the tip of his snout to the tip of his tail a badger is about three feet long. The tail itself measures about four inches. Badgers usually weigh about twenty-five pounds, although a large one may reach up to forty pounds. Badgers are sturdy and strong, with powerful shoulders and claws for digging, and a powerful bite too.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most striking thing about a badger is his markings. Most of the badger's head, including the tips of the ears, is white. Remarkbly there are two thick black stripes running back from the snout and past the eyes and ears on each side of the head.
              </p>
              <p>
                These markings make the badger easily recognisable, even at twilight, which is when badgers first become active.
