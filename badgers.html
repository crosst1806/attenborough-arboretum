            There are two badger setts within the boundaries of the Attenborough Arboretum. There are many different kinds of badger spread across the globe, but here in the UK we have only the European Badger.
            </p>
            <p>
            The European badger is a strange looking creature with some habits in common with humans. For instance, they keep their setts meticulously clean and regularly change the 'bedding' of straw and grass. They also choose a partner and remain faithful to that partner for life.
          </p>

            With his striking markings and strange habits the shy badger is one of the oddest creatures to be found in Great Britain. Badgers are found in most of our counties, but are rarer in those areas which are prone to flooding, such as East Anglia.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the tip of his snout to the tip of his tail a badger is about three feet long. The tail itself measures about four inches. Badgers usually weigh about twenty-five pounds, although a large one may reach up to forty pounds. Badgers are sturdy and strong, with powerful shoulders and claws for digging, and a powerful bite too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most striking thing about a badger is his markings. Most of the badger's head, including the tips of the ears, is white. Remarkbly there are two thick black stripes running back from the snout and past the eyes and ears on each side of the head.
          </p>
          <p>
            These markings make the badger easily recognisable, even at twilight, which is when badgers first become active.

            Badgers are very powerful diggers and move huge amounts of earth when making their underground homes which we call setts. The have long stout claws which they often sharpen by scratching on nearby trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Badgers' setts are usually dug amongst trees where there is plenty of cover. Setts can be very big. The biggest ones may have as many as fifty entrances and stretch for over a hundred yards. At various places along the tunnels are sleeping and breeding chambers.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            Living in such large setts can pose problems. One is that of ventilation. With many badgers sharing a sett the air may become stale and foul. To reduce this problem badgers dig level tunnels so that there are no lower levels where bad air can settle. They also make small air holes along the length of tunnels and these are hidden by twigs.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            the other problem is sanitation and hygiene. Badgers have outside toilets and dig shallow dung pits close to their sett entrances. The chambers in their setts are lined with bedding, usually straw, grass or bracken. The badger brings it to it's sett by dragging a bundle backwards whilst holding it between the front paws and the chin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although most of the bedding is brought in during the autumn months, badgers do change it regularly throughout the rest of the year. Badgers also tend to just use one part of the sett at a time. Badgers have quite poor eyesight and only notice something when it moves. However they do have a strong sense of smell and very good hearing to compensate for this. Badgers can recognise eachother and other animals including humans using this keen sense of smell.

          <h2>Diet</h2>
          
          <p>
            The European badger is omnivorous, meaning that it will eat both plants and animals. Badgers are nocturnal animals, feeding during the night and sleeping by day. In the autumn badgers eat a lot of fruit and seeds, inclduing acorns, blackberries and apples. It is during this time they also dig up eat the bulbs, roots and rhizomes of plants such as bluebells. In the spring, when the tree sap is rising, badgers have been known to strip the bark of sycamores and beeches in order to lick the sweet sappy wood underneath. They will also eat grass, leaves and fungi,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Probably the favourite food of the badger is the worm, of which it eats great quantities. One badger that was killed by a car was found to have over 300 hundred worms in it's stomach. The also eat beetles and slugs and snails too. Wasp nests are a rare treat as they love to eat that fat grubs found inside. Bee nests contain delicious honey! The stinging does not affect the thick skinned badger.
            The European badger will also eat smaller animals. They eat pleanty of rats, mice and voles. Badgers will also eat hedgehogs. The do this by turning the hedgehog onto it's back and prising the balled creature open and biting into the unprotected stomach.
