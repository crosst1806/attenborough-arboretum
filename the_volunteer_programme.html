            The University of Leicester maintains the Attenbrough Arboretum as a free-to-the-public open space and a place of education for local
            schools and organisations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of those living in the Knighton area visit the arboretum on a regular basis. Feedback from these loyal patrons is always very encouraging. The arboretum is seen as a quiet oasis hidden away in the middle of busy suburbia and offering visitors a peaceful, relaxing and rejuvenating walk, at practically anytime of the day, 7 days a week, in beautiful surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who do frequent the park will have noticed that the arboretum, serene and beautiful as it is, could do with a little 'tidying'.
            The University does have a budget for the maintenance of the arboretum, providing one full-time employee on site 5 days a week.
            Main duties and responsibilities cover visitor health and safety and regular housekeeping duties such as grass cutting, shrub pruning, cutting back overhanging branches and litter picking. This leaves little time for amelioration of the arboretum.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where the Volunteer Programme comes in, and why it is crucial to future plans at Carisbrooke Road.

                Much of the work volunteers do involves clearing away the brambles and saplings that have grown up around our specimen trees. 
                These trees have become difficult to view and to approach. The clearing operation allows visitors to properly view 
                the specimen trees in all their glory as originally intended at the arboretum's inception.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ivy that has grown up the trunk and into the canopy is also cut back. This ivy prevents proper examination of the tree during the annual arboreal examination. This reduces the chances of problems such as damaged or weak limbs being rmoved for health and safety reasons and the early spotting of disease.
              </p>
              <p>
                A tree crown full of ivy causes problems in the winter. Deciduous trees droop their leaves in the winter since photosynthesis has stopped. The lack of leave also reduces the tree's 'sail', and reduces the chances of the tree being blown down during winter storms. Ivy, which is
                an evergreen increases the chances of storm damage.
              </p>

            Many of the specimen trees that were planted several decades ago cannot now be seen in their full splendour. Instead, the trunks and lower branches are smothered in ivy, preventing the true distinctive shape and form of the tree and the bark with it's colour and textures. Also,much bramble has sprung up throught the whole area. Again this makes access to some specimens difficult if not impossible.

            Volunteers Needed - Tuesday and Thursday Mornings
          </p>
          <p>
            Attenborough Arboretum is currently running a weekly volunteer porgramme, with sessions taking place on both Tuesday and Thursday mornings. The aboretum is somewhat untidy and there is quite a bit of work to be done to improve the grounds and visitor experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the idea of spending a few hours on a Tuesday and/or Thursday morning helping out around the arboretum appeals, then please contact Tom Cross on 07833 194 007, during working hours for an informal chat about what is involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, you can just turn up on Tuesday or Thursday morning at 8:30 am for a 'taster' session. A session lasts from 8:30 am until 12:30 pm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work consists of light gardening duties; pruning, bulb planting, ivy removal and such-like. Gloves and sensible shoes are required, but all hand tools are provided. There is a break at about 10:30 am with tea, coffee and biscuits.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are not obligated to stay for the full session, nor do you have to commit to every single Tuesday or THursday for volunteer work. The university is grateful for any help received.
