            The University of Leicester maintains the Attenbrough Arboretum as a free-to-the-public open space and a place of education for local
            schools and organisations. Many of those living in the Knighton area, and even further afield, visit the arboretum on a regular basis. 
            Feedback from these loyal patrons is always very encouraging. The arboretum is seen as a quiet oasis hidden away in the middle of a busy neighbourhood. People are delighted that such a place exists on their doorstep, a place that provides a peaceful, relaxing and rejuvenating walk, at practically anytime of the day, 7 days a week.

            Many of the specimen trees that were planted several decades ago cannot now be seen in their full splendour. Instead, the trunks and lower branches are smothered in ivy, preventing the true distinctive shape and form of the tree and the bark with it's colour and textures. Also,much bramble has sprung up throught the whole area. Again this makes access to some specimens difficult if not impossible.

            Although the University does have a budget for maintenance of the arboretum, this covers one employee, the warden (tom Cross), who is on site
            in a fulltime capacity 5 days a week during the working day. His main duties and responsibilities lie in maintaining health and safety and the regular housekeeping duties that are necessary. Grass cutting, trimming back shrubs and overhanging branches, litter picking and

                This is the UK's only native maple. It's a compact, rounded tree with attractive 5-lobed leaves that turn a rich golden 
                yellow in autumn. It produces the hardest, highest density timber of all European maples. It makes a great hedging plant. 
                Druids valued the Field maple for the colour-changing ability when it transforms from silver to gold, a kind of natural alchemy that they called 'sunshine fire'.

                Britain's only native maple is a small round-headed tree often found growing in hedgerows and thus trimmed back to form part of the
