                  Unlike other trees, the plane sheds it's ageing bark regularly in large flakes, leaving behind creamy patches. This prevents the tree becoming stifled under sulphurous grime, and so enables it to thrive even in the polluted atmosphere of big towns and cities.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Though the leaves of the plane are shaped like those of the maple, they are up to 6 inches (15cms) across or more, and are set alternately along the stem and not in opposite pairs as in maples.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The large bright green leaves have spiky teeth. The male flowers are yellow and set farher back on the shoot, whereas the reddish female flowers are to be found at the tip of the shoot.The London plane is actually a hybrid of two other plane species; the American plane and the Oriental plane.

                Heavy swellings on the rough-barked trunk are a distinctive feature of the black poplar.
                The young twigs are yellowish-brown and ridged, and the buds chestnut -brown. Like most poplars 
                it has male and female flowers on separate trees. The Italian poplar is one of the commonest of 
                several fast-growing hybrids between black poplar and two American species, which are often 
                planted as a screen or windbreak.

                  Tall and stately, the Lombardy poplar has become a familiar sight since it was introduced to Britain from northern Italy in the mid-18th century. The branches all follow the trend of the main trunk, instead of spreading outwards, and give the tree a tall, column-like profile.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Most trees are males, so there are very few of the white woolly seeds to be swept up from lawns and pavements. The trees are normally propagated by cuttings. Like all poplars the Lombardy grows quickly and it is often planted as a screen or windbreak across the whole of Britain.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The leaves are alternate and broader than they are longer, with small regular teeth. Crimson catkins appear on the branches March time and ripen to a reddish brown in April. The tree's grey-brown bark has low ridges.

                  The spreading, open-crowned cherry plum looks, at a distance, like the blackthorn, but it blooms earlier and its foliage is not so thick. It's branches are normally smooth, although occasionally they have thorns.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In March and April the cherry plum is smothered in small white flowers as the leaves begin to unfold. The flower buds are on long shoots on either side of a leaf-bud. The fruit is small and round, coloured like a tomato and with a good flavour. The leaves are green and glossy and hairless. They have small rounded teeth.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The damson, with it's hairy leaves and purple fruit, is developed from crosses between the blackthorn and the cherry plum, and is spread over much of Britain.
