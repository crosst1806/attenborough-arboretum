                Growing singly or in small clumps on hills and high moorland, this fine conifer can provide a dramatic touch in an otherwise featureless landscape. As the tree matures it loses it's lower branches and forms a flat, spreading crown.

                It's bark is warm-red on the upper part of the trees and deeply fissured lower down. The needles are shorter than those of other pines. The needles are a blue-green colour and usually come in twisted pairs. The female flowers are crimson in colour and are located at the end of a shoot. The tree can reach 120ft in height.

                Heavy swellings on the rough-barked trunk are a distinctive feature of the black poplar.
                The young twigs are yellowish-brown and ridged, and the buds chestnut -brown. Like most poplars 
                it has male and female flowers on separate trees. The Italian poplar is one of the commonest of 
                several fast-growing hybrids between black poplar and two American species, which are often 
                planted as a screen or windbreak.

                The small leaves of aspen are borne singly on long flattened stalks and flutter in the slightest breeze.
                They are smooth, on both sides, the underside being paler, and turn amber-yellow in autumn. In the wild,
                apens can quickly colonise new ground and rarely grow singly. They send up suckers from their roots which
                often form dense thickets. The silvery-green bark becomes furrowed as the tree ages. The grey poplar is 
                more tolerant of shade than other poplars and grows in damper soils, reaching 75ft(23m) , with massive 
                spreading branches. Aspen leaves have wide teeth and the bark is diamond patterned.

                The blossoms of wild cherry stand out in snow-white patches in beech woods in the spring. The flowers open in April, before the leaves appear. The leaves have long points and regular teeth, and are borne on red stalks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many cherry trees that have been cultivated for their fruit derive from the wild cherry,, whose fruits grow in bunches of three to five, and can taste sweet or bitter. They turn from a yellowish shade to red in July and are a favourite food of the birds. The cherries that survive to later turn blackish.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tree has a shiny, chestnut-brown bark which peels in horizontal strips. Wild cherry grows rapidly to timber size, and so the wood is often used to make furniture, veneers and pipes. The leaves are alternate, with long points and regular, forward-pointing teeth. The twigs are a grey-brown colour, and the buds brown and shiny and clustered on side-shoots.

                Few trees can match the bird cherry's display of flowers in late May, when it's white blossoms hang in long bunches and spread a strong almond-like scent. The fruit, which ripens in July and August, is bitter and edible only for birds. The bark peels and has scattered pores; it's smell is unpleasant, but in the Middle Ages it was the source of a medecine for upset stomachs.

                Bird cherry is often planted as an ornamental tree. It tends to flourish father north than wild cherry. The fruit is black with a hrad, oval stone. The leaves are alternate and fine-toothed, and the flowers are borne in semi-erect or hanging spikes.
