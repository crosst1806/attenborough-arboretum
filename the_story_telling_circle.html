              "The Teddy Bears' Picnic" is a song consisting of a melody written in 1907 by American composer John Walter Bratton, and lyrics added in 1932 by Irish songwriter Jimmy Kennedy.

            Woodlands and story telling have always gone together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it is the dark, foreboding woods as described in the tale of Hanzel and Gretel, 
            or the happy playful woods that Winnie the Pooh and his friends inhabited.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Of course, in the dark days of winter the best place for spinning yarns and telling stories is beside a roaring fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when the warm summer months arrive then under a tall tree, such as an old oak or a spreading willow is the right spot. 
          </p>
          <p>
            How fortunate we are then, for at the Attenborough Arboretum we have our own special story telling circle. Complete with majestic 'Golden Weeping' willows.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the lower end of the arboretum, near the pond, surrounded by brambles, you will find a magic place, that is just perfect for reading
            stories to little ones.

            Next time you visit don't forget to bring your child's favourite story book. Then you can spend some magical time together, out-witting giants, 
            climbing bean stalks or slaying dragons.
          </p>
          <p>
            And don't worry if you've forgotten a book. On many days the 'story telling box' can be found under the willows. A selection of stories,
            kept in a watertight box, always ready for another read. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Just pick a story and let the magic begin !
