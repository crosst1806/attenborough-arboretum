                The small leaves of aspen are borne singly on long flattened stalks and flutter in the slightest breeze.
                They are smooth, on both sides, the underside being paler, and turn amber-yellow in autumn. In the wild,
                apens can quickly colonise new ground and rarely grow singly. They send up suckers from their roots which
                often form dense thickets. The silvery-green bark becomes furrowed as the tree ages. The grey poplar is 
                more tolerant of shade than other poplars and grows in damper soils, reaching 75ft(23m) , with massive 
                spreading branches. Aspen leaves have wide teeth and the bark is diamond patterned.

                Growing singly or in small clumps on hills and high moorland, this fine conifer can provide a dramatic touch in an otherwise featureless landscape. As the tree matures it loses it's lower branches and forms a flat, spreading crown.

                It's bark is warm-red on the upper part of the trees and deeply fissured lower down. The needles are shorter than those of other pines. The needles are a blue-green colour and usually come in twisted pairs. The female flowers are crimson in colour and are located at the end of a shoot. The tree can reach 120ft in height.

                The slim trunk with silvery-white bark, that often peels, makes this tree one of the most decorative and easily recognised of Britain's native trees. It is a pioneering tree, that is, one of the first trees to establish itself on newly cleared land or burned heaths. Along with the Rowan, it grow's higher up the sides of mountains than any other tree.

                The long, whip-like twigs are shiny and red-brown, and the branches are usually drooping, hence the latin name pendula; 'hanging'. On mature trees the bark is covered with black, diamond-shaped patches. It is not a long-lived tree.

                It is the soft white hairs on the shoots and leaf-stalks of this tree that give it it's name. It also differs from silver birch in having darker brown twigs and bark that is reddish-brown and missing the black patches characteristic of mature silver birch. The downy birch prefers wetter areas, and is a quick coloniser of poor soils.

                Few trees can match the bird cherry's display of flowers in late May, when it's white blossoms hang in long bunches and spread a strong almond-like scent. The fruit, which ripens in July and August, is bitter and edible only for birds. The bark peels and has scattered pores; it's smell is unpleasant, but in the Middle Ages it was the source of a medecine for upset stomachs.

                Bird cherry is often planted as an ornamental tree. It tends to flourish father north than wild cherry. The fruit is black with a hrad, oval stone. The leaves are alternate and fine-toothed, and the flowers are borne in semi-erect or hanging spikes.

                Britain's only native maple is a small round-headed tree often found growing in hedgerows and thus trimmed back to form part of the
                hedgerow. As such it makes avery good hedging plant. It's a compact, rounded tree with attractive 5-lobed leaves that turn a rich golden 
                yellow in autumn. It produces the hardest, highest density timber of all European maples.In woodlands on chalky soils in the south-east of the country it may grow taller, but seldom as high as the other maples. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The tree can be easily recognised by the rounded lobes of it's leaves. It has has corky twigs and a ribbed grey or light brown bark with fine shallow fissures. Small flowers appear in the upright spikes in May or June. fruits form in pairs, with with the wings set straighter than in other maples.

                Clusters of bright yellow flower appearing in March and leaves that turn golden-orange in the Autumn make the Norway maple a popular ornamental tree for planting in city streets and parks. It is a very hardy tree. This is not surprising as it is a native of Scandanavia, from where it was introduced to the British Isles in the 17th century.

              <p>
                The Norway maple is a shorter and more slender tree than the sycamore, with a more open crown and less dense foliage.The leaves are thin, shiny and light green in colour. The lobes on the leaves are sharply pointed.

                The massive domed outline of the sycamore, tallest and commonest member of the maple family, has become a familiar sight in Britain's gardens and woods since it was introduced from France in the Middle Ages. The sycamore has proved hardy even in the bleakest of conditions, and spreads vigorously, even on waste ground, by means of it's winged fruits. These twirl through the October air like tiny helicopter blades.

                The leaves, often spotted with disease, are set in opposite pairs and the branches are spread out evenly. The flowers appear in May and June. The leaves are large and leathery. The teeth are regular and the foliage is dark green in colour.

              The common alder is one of the few trees whose leaves remain green well into the autumn. But it is the catkins that appear that give the tree it's unmistakable main characteristic. After the fruits of the female catkins have ripened in October they stay on the tree all winter as small brown woody cones, until the seeds are all dispersed in the spring.
              </p>
              <p>
              The leaves of the common alder are roundish oval in shape and shiny. The tips of the leaves are often notched, as though a small bite had been taken out of the leaf. It's cousin the Grey Alder (Alnus incana) can be distinguished by a grey underside to the leaf. The leaves are also pointed and toothed. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Alders often grow near rivers as they prefer wet environments. The alder's suckers make it useful at binding river banks and the tree can grow up to 80ft in height.
